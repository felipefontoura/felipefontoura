# Hi, i'm Felipe Fontoura ✌

_family man && entrepreneur && software engineer_

When the world sleeps, I create. Armed with nothing but my trusty laptop and an endless supply of coffee, I'm a one-person army turning ideas into digital reality. No venture capital, no big teams – just pure passion and code flowing through my fingertips.

Think of me as a digital artisan in the age of mass-produced software. I craft websites, build digital products, and breathe life into startup-style projects, all while the city lights twinkle outside my window.

### 🌟 Where to Find Me

I occasionally emerge from my coding cave to share thoughts and creations:

- 🚀 [Personal Site](https://felipefontoura.com) - Where my projects come to life

- 💻 [GitHub](https://github.com/felipefontoura) - Peek into my code sanctuary (here)
- 🛠 [Product Hunt](#) - Hunt my latest launches

### 🎯 What I Do

By day (and most nights), I'm a digital swiss army knife – part developer, part designer, part product strategist. I build and ship products that solve real problems, without the fancy VC pitch decks or corporate red tape.

What makes me tick:

- 🚀 Crafting indie SaaS products from zero to launch
- 💡 Turning coffee into code and ideas into products
- 🎨 Designing minimal, user-focused experiences
- 📊 Growing products through clever automation and marketing

### 🛠 My Toolkit

In the fast-paced world of startups, choosing the right tools is crucial. That's why I swear by Ruby on Rails - it's the perfect weapon for turning ideas into profitable products at lightning speed:

```
⚡️ Rapid Development Stack   🏗 Production Power
----------------------      -------------------
Ruby on Rails               PostgreSQL
Hotwire (Turbo+Stimulus)    Redis
TailwindCSS                 Sidekiq
ViewComponents              AWS/Heroku
```

Time to MVP: Days, not months 🚀

### 👨‍🎓 Education & Learning

Yes, I have a CS degree from University of Vale do Paraíba (BSc, Computer Engineering, 2001-2006), but my real education never stops. Most of what I know comes from:

- 💡 Building real products
- 📖 Late night documentation deep-dives
- 🎓 The University of Trial & Error
- ☕️ Countless cups of coffee
