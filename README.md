**Senior Backend Developer — Fintech & Bitcoin Infrastructure**

Building payment gateways and exchange systems on the Liquid Network. 25+ years shipping production software, from satellite hardware at INPE to multi-currency checkout systems at TUI Group (23B EUR). Currently focused on bridging traditional payment rails to Bitcoin using AI-driven development workflows.

Bitcoin maximalist. 100% in. I don't advertise it — I just build on it.

### What I'm Building

**Payment Gateway & OTC Exchange on the Liquid Network** — Fiat on-ramp (PIX → tokens) with an exchange engine for trading against L-BTC and USDT, settled on-chain. Built in 70 days, solo, using AI-driven workflows. Private repo.

`Node.js` `TypeScript` `Fastify` `Drizzle ORM` `PostgreSQL` `BullMQ` `Redis` `Elements Core` `Kubernetes` `Terraform`

- 13-app monorepo (Turborepo), 3 Fastify APIs, 3 PostgreSQL databases
- Provider-agnostic PIX integration (4 PSPs via factory pattern)
- OTC exchange engine with VWAP pricing, 5-source price aggregation, asymmetric spreads
- Exchange Settler with deposit detection, tolerance-based auto-refund, crash recovery
- Full OAuth 2.1/OIDC auth server (5 roles, 19 scopes, JWKS, M2M)
- Kubernetes (DOKS, HPA), Prometheus/Grafana, GitHub Actions CI/CD

### Spec-Driven Development (SDD)

A methodology I developed for AI-assisted coding with Claude Code. Structured specs (requirements, design docs, API contracts) as the single source of truth for AI-generated implementations. Multi-agent patterns: architect, implementer, reviewer — each with defined boundaries and human approval gates.

Used to build the 13-app fintech monorepo in 70 days. Trained 400+ professionals in the methodology.
